INTRODUCTION                                                         *neo-tree*

Neo-tree is a plugin for nvim that can display tree structures in a sidebar.
The current version supports one source, which is a filesystem browser. Future
versions will add suport for other sources.


BASIC USAGE                                              *Neo-tree-Basic-Usage*

Neo-tree does not define any default commands or keybindings for nvim. The
suggested keybinding is:

nnoremap / lua require('neo-tree').focus()

`focus()` will open the sidebar and focus it if it is closed, and just switch to
the neo-tree window if it is already open. You can also use `show()` which will
do the same if it is closed, but won't switch to the neo-tree window if it is
already open.


CONFIGURATION                                          *Neo-tree-Configruation*

To override the defaults or add new functionality, call the setup() function
with your overrides. For example, to add your own mappings in 'lua':
>
require("neo-tree").setup({
  filesystem = {
    window = {
      mappings = {
        ["<F5>"] = "refresh",
        ["o"] = "open",
      }
    }
  }
})
>
For a complete example of all the settings that can be changed, see the
defaults.lua file for the version you are using at: 
https://github.com/nvim-neo-tree/neo-tree.nvim/blob/main/lua/neo-tree/defaults.lua

NAVIGATION                                                *Neo-tree-Navigation*

Within the neo-tree window, the following mappings are defined by default.
Note: The "selected" item is the line the cursor is currently on.

<2-LeftMouse> = open:        Expand or collapse a folder. If a file is selected,
                             open it in the window closest to the tree.
<cr>          = open:        Same as above.
S             = open_split:  Same as open, but opens in a new horizontal split.
s             = open_vsplit: Same as open, but opens in a vertical split
<bs>          = navigate_up: Moves the root directory up one level.
.             = set_root:    Changes the root directory to the currently 
                             selected folder.


FILE ACTIONS                                            *Neo-tree-File-Actions*
a    = add:                  Create a new file or directory.
d    = delete:               Delete the selected file or directory.
r    = rename:               Rename the selected file or directory.
c    = copy_to_clipboard:    Mark file to be copied.
x    = cut_to_clipboard:     Mark file to be cut (moved).
p    = paste_from_clipboard: Copy/move each marked file in the to the
                             selected folder.


VIEW CHANGES                                            *Neo-tree-View-Changes*
H = toggle_hidden:    Toggle whether hidden files (.*) are shown or not.
I = toggle_gitignore: Toggle whether the gitignore file is
                      respected.
R = refresh:          Rescan the filesystem and redraw the tree. Changes
                      made within nvim should be detected automatically, but
                      this is useful for changes made elsewhere.


FILTER                                                        *Neo-tree-Filter*
/     = filter_as_you_type: Filter the tree recursively, searching for
                            files and folders that contain the specified term as
                            you type. This will fd if it is installed, or find.
f     = filter_on_submit:   Same as above, but does not search until you hit
                            enter. Useful if filter_as_you_type is too slow.
<C-x> = clear_filter:       Removes the filter.
